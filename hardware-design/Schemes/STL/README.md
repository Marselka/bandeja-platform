Handle can be printed diagonally on the 220x220mm bed with 0,28mm layer height. Holes for connection between two parts require M5 screws.

Both parts can be printed with 0,2mm layer height. Diagonal holes require M5 screws but mostly for attaching the case to something because hook-shaped connectors are designed to hold the two parts together.
