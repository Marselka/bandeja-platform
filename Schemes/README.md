## Main chassis

The main chassis was cut on a laser cutter from 6.3mm thickness plywood. There are three of components: frame (top left), base (top right) and connector (bottom right). Connectors (4 pieces) were put in the 30x6.3mm square holes on the base and the frame and the all the parts were glued together. All the measurements given here are in millimeters and degrees. The SVG file needed for laser cutting and all the schemes can be found in the **Images** directory. **(TBD)**

## Camera mount

The mount is made of 40x40mm aluminum profile. L-shape brackets used here are just for reference as it could be impossible to find the exact ones. Though it should be noted that it is necessary to drill holes not only for screws but also on the opposite side for an easy access with a screwdriver.

## Attachments

After screwing the camera mount to the main chassis a case for MCU (stm32f407 in our case) and handles were printed. STL and FCStd files for the models can be found in the corresponding directories **(STL and FreeCAD)**. Azure Kit was place below the mount and a mobile phone ontop using holder with cameras vertically alligned with Azure. Intel NUC and the battery were placed on the base. Positioning of other electronic components depends on the personal preferences (in our case stm32 was screwed directly to the frame and IMU to the camera mount).
